# First-Person-Shooter
This here is a First Person Shooter made in Objective C++


To run this game, you must download *ALL* the files.

The *raylib.dll* file is the library used and the *.pdb* files is an important file to run this program.

Make sure you have downloaded all the files, and then you can enjoy a basic-First Person Shooter.

I am currently still working on this game, and am planning to add multiplayer functionality to it.

cya :)
